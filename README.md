# CSPB4502 Spring 2022 Project: Anime Recommendation System

Team members: Matthew Fournier, Christie Hui

## Description

The aim of this project is to create an anime recommendation system for users based on existing user data obtained from MyAnimeList.net, which is essentially a cataloging site which allows users to keep lists of which anime they’ve seen/plan to see, view user reviews of anime titles, and rate shows based on a scale from 1-10. The motivation behind choosing this topic is due to a shared common interest in anime as well as prior familiarity with MyAnimeList site functionality. The knowledge and results gained from the analysis of this data set may be beneficial for future personal decisions regarding choosing an anime to watch.

Based on certain features from the data set – such as anime titles, genres, and ratings, to name a few – we aim to discover and answer interesting questions such as:

- Which genres (of anime) contribute to ambiguous users’ watching decisions?
- How much do features such as rating, episode count, and anime type influence a user’s viewing choices?
- Is the popularity of an anime or similarity to other users’ profiles/viewing preferences more significant in impacting a user’s preferences?
